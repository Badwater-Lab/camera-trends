## Our motivations
We'd like to practice our skills in Python data scraping and D3.js
data visualization. We are both photography enthusiasts. We are interested
in which camera brand will lead the market in the future.

## Our question
Out of three major camera brands, Canon, Nikon, and Sony, which one
will dominate the mirrorless market?

## Methodology
We scrape Google trend indices from 2004 to 2020 as a function of
time and countries and correlate them with annual revenues. We use
D3.js to visualize the data. We then predict future trends with
machine learning.

## Results and discussion
Our final product is shown here:
