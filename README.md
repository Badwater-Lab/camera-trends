# Project NextGen

### Founding team members: Aaron Tang and Skyler Dong (equal partners)
### Date created: April 4, 2020

## Our topic is:
Out of three major camera brands, Canon, Nikon, and Sony, which one
will dominate the mirrorless market?

We scrape Google trend indices from 2004 to 2020 as a function of
time and countries and correlate them with annual revenues. We use
D3.js to visualize the data. We then predict future trends with
machine learning.

Our final product is shown here:

This is a work in progress.
